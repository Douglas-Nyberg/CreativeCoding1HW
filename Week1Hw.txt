Command Line Interfaces (CLIs), while potentially less user-friendly, offer significant advantages. A prime example of a CLI application is Vim. Mastery of such applications grants enhanced control and flexibility, allowing for the efficient completion of repetitive or complex tasks. I'm personally still on the journey to becoming fluent in Vim.

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are typically the starting point for most users. They enable interaction through digital icons, simplifying process initiation. For example, downloading a library like NumPy via a GUI would involve using a search engine to find NumPy, navigating to the appropriate page, and clicking to download it. Conversely, the same task on the command line is as straightforward as typing `pip3 install numpy`.

Using a GUI can sometimes be overwhelming, especially in certain applications like database management. I prefer swiftly navigating through tables and directories, which can become cumbersome with a GUI-based database manager. It's easy to lose track of where you are. Additionally, when running models, GUI-based IDEs like IntelliJ may not always yield consistent results due to differences in plugins and configurations. This inconsistency can be problematic. To ensure my scripts work universally, I often run them through the command line as a final check, confirming they function correctly on other machines and not just my own.
